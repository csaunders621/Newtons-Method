# Newtons-Method
The objective of this course project is to create a logistic regression model from scratch that utilizes Newton’s Method to optimize the weights. This model is used to train and predict on the Breast Cancer Wisconsin UCI dataset. For Newton’s method, we need to compute the log likelihood function, the gradient, and the hessian in order to calculate the steps for our weights. 

The 'breat-cancer-wisconsin.data' file contains the dataset that is used, the 'breast-cancer-wisconsin.names' file explains the meaning behind the data and how it is organized, and the 'newtons_method.ipynb' file is a Jupyter Notebook file that shows the development of the logistic regression model.
